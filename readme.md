Brief instructions:
Type "act_show on" in the console. This will let you see action IDs on the right click menu.

Bind your hotkey using 'bind <key> "act <id> hover"'. The double quotes around the action are required. For example bind ctrl+b "act 222 hover" will open the bank window if you hover your mouse over a settlement token and press ctrl+b
